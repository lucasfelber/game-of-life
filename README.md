# Conway's Game of Life

A small project to using Conway's Game of Life to simulate cellular automation.

## Description

The Game of Life is a cellular automation running on a grid that only relies on three simple rules:
1. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
2. Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
3. All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

This is a Java project using the Processing library.
